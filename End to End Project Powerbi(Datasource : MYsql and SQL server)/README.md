New End-to-End Power BI Project (Data Sources: MySQL Database and SQL Server)
Initially, we create the reports using data available in the test environment. Once the reports are developed and validated, we transition them from the test environment to the production environment.

Another common scenario in real-world projects involves data source transitions. For example, an organization or client may decide to switch from Microsoft SQL Server to a MySQL database. In such cases, as a Power BI developer or data analyst, you must migrate all existing reports from SQL Server to MySQL.

Transitioning Process:
Install the MySQL Connector: Ensure that the MySQL connector is installed to establish the connection in Power BI.

Data Preparation: Perform data cleaning and preparation similar to the process in SQL Server.

Data Source Update: Update data source connections in Power BI from SQL Server to MySQL.

Validation: Verify that all visuals, measures, and calculations are working correctly after the transition.
