 Ride Booking Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)
Tools: Power BI, DAX, Excel, ChatGPT

Dataset: 10,001+ synthetic ride records generated using ChatGPT, simulating a real-world ride-hailing service (Bykea), with booking status, ride distance, fare, customer rating, payment method, and vehicle type.

Conceptualized and built an end-to-end BI dashboard project by generating a realistic dataset using ChatGPT, mimicking the operations of a ride-booking platform.

Cleaned and structured the dataset to reflect common industry formats and behaviors, including driver/customer cancellations, payment diversity, and vehicle classifications.

Developed advanced DAX measures to analyze:

Average Customer Rating, excluding null/zero values.

Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance and Most Booked Vehicle using RANKX and COUNTROWS.

Cancellation Rate broken down by reason.

Most Used Payment Method using conditional logic with IF, Logical operators,Summarize, and CALCULATE.

and so many other measures 

Created interactive visuals with time-based filters, dynamic KPIs, and insights for decision-makers.
