This project presents a comprehensive customer analytics solution designed to improve conversion rates, enhance customer engagement, 
and optimize feedback scores. Using Power BI, I developed interactive dashboards that visualize key metrics such as monthly conversion trends, 
engagement through views, clicks, and likes, and average customer feedback. SQL was used for efficient data extraction and transformation from structured databases, 
while Python powered the sentiment analysis of customer reviews to identify recurring positive and negative themes. By combining these tools, 
the project offers actionable insights into user behaviorâ€”pinpointing drop-off stages in the customer journey, highlighting the effectiveness of marketing content, and uncovering patterns in customer sentiment.
This end-to-end analysis supports data-driven decision-making to improve user experience and product performance.
