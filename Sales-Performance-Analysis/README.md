#Project description.

Developed a Power BI dashboard to track utility consumption (electricity, gas, steam, and water) against production levels for a textile department. Integrated data from multiple sources, including Excel sheets, to create interactive dashboards and reports. Set up KPIs to monitor resource usage per unit of production and identify inefficiencies. The dashboard helped the client optimize energy use, reduce costs, and make data-driven decisions.
